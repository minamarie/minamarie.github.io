        <h2>O V E R V I E W </h2>
        <p>Now, this is a story all about how
            My life got flipped-turned upside down
            And I liked to take a minute
            Just sit right there
            I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel Air
            In west Philadelphia born and raised
            On the playground was where I spent most of my days
            Chillin' out maxin' relaxin' all cool
            And all shootin some b-ball outside of the school
            When a couple of guys who were up to no good
            Started making trouble in my neighborhood
            I got in one little fight and my mom got scared
            She said 'You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel Air'
            I begged and pleaded with her day after day
            But she packed my suite case and send me on my way
            She gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket.
            I put my walkman on and said, 'I might as well kick it'.
            First class, yo this is bad
            Drinking orang juice out of a champagne glass.
            Is this what the people of Bel-Air Living like?
            Hmm this might be alright.
            But wait I hear they're prissy, bourgeois, all that
            Is Bel-Air the type of place they send this cool cat?
            I don't think so
            I'll see when I get there
            I hope they're prepared for the prince of Bel-Air
            Well uh the plane landed and when I came out
            There was a dude who looked like a cop standing there with my name out
            I ain't trying to get arrested yet
            I just got here
            I sprang with the quickness like lightening, disappeared
            I whistled for a cab and when it came near
            The license plate said fresh and it had dice in the mirror
            If anything I can say this cab is rare
            But I thought 'Now forget it' - 'Yo homes to Bel Air'
            I pulled up to the house about seven or eight
            And I yelled to the cabbie 'Yo, homes smell ya later'
            I looked at my kingdom
            I was finally there
            To sit on my throne as the Prince of Bel Air</p>
